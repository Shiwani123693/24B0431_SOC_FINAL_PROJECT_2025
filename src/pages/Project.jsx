          I've worked on several hands-on projects using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript to deepen my understanding of web development. These
          projects reflect my learning journey and creativity. Many are
          open-source, so if something catches your interest, feel free to
          explore the code and share your ideas—I'd love to collaborate and grow
          together!"
